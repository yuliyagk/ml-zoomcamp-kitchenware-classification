# Project: Kitchenware Classification
Project created at cohort 2022 of ML Zoomcamp course.

The dataset I downloaded  from the kaggle.com competition at:
[Kitchenware Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kitchenware-classification/data)


## Classification
From the competition I needed to classify images of different kitchenware items into 6 classes:

* cups
* glasses
* plates
* spoons
* forks
* knives

The files I downloaded to the following location

## The solution includes:

Data preprocessing
Model training using TensorFlow/Keras
API deployment with Flask for real-time predictions

## Tech Stack
Python
TensorFlow / Keras
NumPy & Pandas
Flask (for model serving)
Jupyter Notebook

## Workflow
Images → Preprocessing → Model Training → Evaluation → Flask API → Predictions

## Project Structure

├── notebook.ipynb          # model training and experimentation
├── train.py                # training script (if exists)
├── predict_service.py      # Flask API for predictions
├── test_service.py         # script to test API
├── models/                 # saved model files
├── data/                   # dataset (if included)

## Model
Deep learning model built with Keras
Trained on labeled kitchenware images
Optimized for multi-class classification

## Files

* data/train.csv - the training set (Image IDs and classes)
* data/test.csv - the test set (Just image IDs)
* data/sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format (this I did not use)
* data/images/ - the images in the JPEG format

## Building the Model

For building the model I used the notebook keras-learning.ipynb. 
Where I used the training images.

I have build the model using keras tensorflow.

## Providing a service

* predict_service.py - python script with the flask service
* test_service.py - python script to test the service

I have created the predict_service.py which is taking a image url and
predicts which kind of kitchenware it is.

The script test_service.py is using a local file to test if the prediction is correct.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project I learned:

How to build image classification models
Working with TensorFlow/Keras
Data preprocessing for images
Serving ML models with Flask
Structuring end-to-end ML projects
